            <p>One of the most important rules is <strong>castling</strong>. This is used to move your king out of the center of the board and put it into a defended position. There are two ways you can castle: short and long, or kingside and queenside.</p>
            <p>In order to castle, several conditions must be met. First, you must not have moved the king yet during the game, or the rook on the side you wish to castle on. Next, you cannot castle if you are in check, castling moves you through check, or if the rook on the castling side is under attack. In the image above, assuming that no rooks have moved and the king hasn't moved, white is eligible to castle on both sides.</p>
            <p>If white chooses to castle kingside, the king and rook change positions as shown. Note again that if any of the squares between the king's starting and ending spots are attacked by an enemy piece, white cannot castle.</p>
            
            <p>If white chooses to castle queenside, the king and queenside rook change positions as shown. Note that queenside castling is usually more aggressive than kingside castling, and white usually takes an additional move shifting her king to the left to put it under greater protection.</p>
            
            <p>The next most important rule is <strong>pawn promotion</strong>. Obviously, once a pawn reaches the end of the board, it has no more moves, as there are no more forward spaces. Instead, it may promote. This means that it can change into any other piece in the game, except for a king or another pawn. The most common promotion is to a queen. This is extremely powerful: with pawn promotions, it is possible to have multiple queens on the board at the same time. Note that if it is white's move in the picture above, white will push the pawn, promote to a queen, and checkmate the black king. he next most important rule is <strong>pawn promotion</strong>.

            <p>Since a queen dominates a rook or a bishop, the vast majority of the time it doesn't make sense to promote to either of those. Sometimes, a player will promote to a knight. These usually involve special, complex scenarios that won't be discussed here.</p>
            
            <p>The last special rule we'll talk about is <strong>en passant</strong>. This is the least-known rule. The idea is that if a player takes advantage of the two-space push rule for pawns, on the turn <em>immediately after</em>, his opponent may "capture" the pawn as if the pawn only moved forward one space. This only works for the turn immediately after. In the image above, if black waits a turn, she may no longer use the en passant rule.</p>
            <p>If she chooses to use en passant to capture, this is what it would look like:</p>
            
            <p>Note that en passant is the only case where a piece can capture another piece without moving onto the captured piece's square. Note too that only pawns can capture en passant. Other pieces, like bishops or knights, cannot capture this way.</p>
            
            <p>Lastly, some technicalities. You don't really have to know all this until you become somewhat intermediate, but some exposure is worth it. There are two ways a game can end: one player wins and the other loses, or the game is <strong>drawn</strong>.</p>
            <p>Straight up winning is the simplest. A player wins if he checkmates his opponent, or if his opponent <strong>resigns</strong> (surrenders) voluntarily. In timed games, a player also wins if her opponent runs out of time.</p>
