*Snow
2/11/16

It’s snowing and the air
is made of paper. I’m
breathing it, tearing it. And you’re
not here right now and
between us only wind folding.
Did you ever think about that?
The small creases that we leave—
gently refilling, so careful
you could glance away for just a second
and look back to find only white.

*Ode to Chinatown
2/12/16

I hit you like a speed bump.
You and your red lamps
fat on light, family-safe alleys
where all men look like Grandpa--
you’re the awkward one here.
Shuffling your feet halfway
between San Francisco and the sea,
you chose not
to realize you don’t belong,
to wait in my way
not even smiling with your
sizzling, smoky, sour teeth,
just breathing. To whom
do you call? Aren’t you tired
of lies? But even this
you don’t notice. You go on mumbling.
Your face is sheer as snow.
I drive past, tongue cold
from the bitter scald of tea.

*Psalm
2/13/16

Dickinson and your shattered meter that I pick through like fish bones,
Whitman and your draping, singing lines,
Hemingway of the sinews,
Ginsberg and your use of the word fuck,
Pound of the semicolon,
McCarthy the smooth-talker, the preacher,
Cummings the maker of jungles,
Neruda and your child-eyed glory in things,
Basho the razor-keen,
Tolstoy the chronicler,
Faulkner, your yellowing pages burning with summer heat,
Frost who considers more than life,
Murakami the conversationalist,
Twain whose cricket-song hums even through all that,
Proulx brittle as ice,
Vonnegut trying not to laugh,
LeGuin and your respect for dreams,
O’Brien the scarred,
Shakespeare weaver of tapestries,
Hughes who will stroll with me along empty streets,
all you who live and still live--
fix me for I am broken.

*poem for people who don’t want to go back to high school
2/14/16

don’t you wish life was
algebra--you know, the tangled
script falling asleep on its own
fractions that you still can’t
remember how to solve--I
know what you are thinking, why
would I ever want to give
breath to such a nightmare but
believe me it wouldn’t be
so bad, everything would be right
there, all the answers, and all
you’d need to find them is the
stuff you’ve yet to remember--
complete the square, rationalize
the denominator and even if you
are reading this thinking who
does this guy think he is and
what the hell is he saying don’t
you realize how much freer you
could be with all the messes
you’ll ever snag against up there
for the solving, everything you
will ever be depressed by waiting
for you to unravel the truth,
and all you have to do is this:
let zero cancel zero:
revert problem into solution,
knot into string, follow
smoke home to fire.

*Yellow Light
2/15/16

I tell you I’m a terrible
driver and you’re like what’s
that supposed to mean. I’m
like I almost crashed into the
mailman and you don’t
want to see me park. I can’t
tell how much less
interested you are so I start
talking about the yellow
light I almost didn’t run.

So I tried to slow and
ended up inertial in the middle
of the intersection and my
dad’s like kid either you
stop all the way or
step on it straight through.
You are mostly not laughing.
Oh shit. What
are you thinking? I ask.

You’re like I’m not thinking
about much. You start
to look away.
The light changes.

*Ode to a Thing in Three Parts
2/16/16

i.
what name will absolve u?
from wood & steel u
came & to wood &
steel u don’t want to go back.
thing, u cling to existence like
most things do, like food that
hates to stay eaten. ur
insecure wires think they
still fit your grooves. ur twin
clamps clack like unrenewed friends.

ii.
thing what is it u
want me to do? will my
fingers redefine u? will u
ingratiate yourself into the
being of another? is it really
becoming if it’s less?

iii.
& u r really abstraction
thing
when i tried giving u a chance
u could have made urself couldnt u
u could have fixed urself
what is death but ambiguity
thing u could have
& is nothing forever &
how long is that

*Elegy for Brother
2/17/16

Brother in the mail.
Brother of the bathtub, grime-skinned,
filling faster than it drains.
Brother of the staff. Brother
the deceiver. Brother gleaming
in the duct tape. Money brother.
Dawn brother. Cloud-plumed, prehistoric,
glowing like coals brother. Brother
in the water & on the stone.
Brother in the deer with
eyes hot and green. Pen brother.
Gone brother. Deep brother. Top
card of the deck brother.
Brother of the inflated wheel.
Brother of rap. Country brother,
grass brother. Brother
in the mirror of the brother.
In the similar triangles the
brother. In the mud of spring,
brother of the bow. Brother
of heaps and stacks. Keys
brother. Sandwich brother. Lost brother.
Who else to name you brother?

Brother you. Brother me. Brother
sifting through Poptart. Egg-frying
brother. Brother in the Bible.
Brother on the web. Moon flat
brother. Brother the desperate. No
lunch brother. Rook queen and brother.
Sky raining brother. Coyote yowling
for the brother in the
dark who is brother. Brother dog
biting. Dogfighting brother. Brother
in the slanted light. Fog
rolling through brother. Brother
music. Brother blood. Brother ink.
Cosine of brother. Faster
than brother. Clock brother. Story
brother. Brother through the cross.
Brother of the highway. Four
am brother. Loud brother.
Quiet brother. Wispy brother. Gone
brother. Here brother. Brother
brother. Bristle and bramble
and mosquito and brother. Motel
brother. Brother of morning
frost. Brother of the earth that
shrinks from our touch. Brother
of decaf and tea, of airplane
and train and bus and feet.
Our feet. Brother feet. Brother
of the unrendered stream. We dip
fingers in liquid ice to find
it still moves.

*To Walden
2/20/16

I ask for meaning &
you give me the
goose.

seedy hicks like
swans fallen in with
the wrong crowd & four
years into a drug
problem that’s not going anywhere.

I don’t think I’ll
ever tire of watching those
rubber necks jack-
hammering their own feathers but
that’s another story.

almost too perfect how
they glide like
origami as if
shitting’s not enough.

those beaks snatching water
and then necks.

wings buffing and snorting
as the crowd gathers.

so it begins:
another spring, another
garbage pond and two
feathered chests bumping in
what I can never tell is
sex or war.

*Sickness
2/21/16

the first thing you gave
me was a cough. we
passed it back and forth,
the way you’re supposed

to take alternating bites
out of an apple or
share a milkshake but all
we shared were germs.

maybe that’s how it’s
supposed to go, catching
each other like a cold,
passing back and forth love
like a bad mood. 

how I lay in bed feeling
mucous drip against raw
throat thinking, is this
what romantic means, drowning

in my own bodily
fluids every time I see you?
blowing my nose like
a breakup? we got better,

flushed it out of our system,
and it was never the same.

after snowstorm
water dripping
like rain

shoveling
waterlogged snow
old regrets

*Chess

was	always meant
for family	your
puzzles	     pit
against mine
every piece	with a counterpart
like	brothers	maybe
sisters      two queens
whose freedom      only chains them
to who needs them     and
a dumb king	clumsy
as love

*reading the poem
2/24/16

let us together taste
the sugarcube moon, cooler
than a cough drop. if

this world is less
than enough, listen
to the highway
and think of the sea. don’t

let things be what
they are. those airplane
lights are the stars
waving back at you,
and my hand
is an artifact. why

fret when your life
isn’t changing? when you
hear voices think first
of mythology. let

your coffee be earth and
your bedroom sigh. then
maybe
we will see how things are,
the second before dawn
more than night.

*Empty Classroom, 2016
@after James Wright
2/25/16

a triangle of sun
shies away
from the abandoned textbook.
the air conditioning
grumbles to a hush
closing to silence.
windows, rolled
up like sleeves,
let in summer
and voices, engine
rearing, sound
of leaving.
I have waited too long.

*Ode to Dirt
2/26/16

nobody was afraid of the ground. because the ground was everywhere and it was us. whatever we did we did in the dirt. we dug holes out of the dirt and hid other people’s water bottles in the dirt and when we didn’t want them anymore sprayed piss all over the dirt. we sat in the dirt and when we got up we didn’t brush it off. dirt like coffee stains and coffee grains and the chalk of the truth. we played video games in the dirt, got into fights in the dirt, smoked freeze dried noodles over the dirt and when we ate we ate dirt. we played dirty and we talked dirty. we sweat dirt. we slept on dirt, dreamed of worlds where there’s dirt, black dirt, pale dirt, dirt that clings like lichen and dirt that roils like fog, dirt that doesn’t apologize. we drank out of the dirt and called it holy water. we pressed ourselves against carpet grass late past midnight and smelled it, breathed it, dirt wet and alive. we took dirt by the handful, caught our nails full of dirt, threw dirt sizzling and going up like smoke. our hands built us and our hands were veined with dirt. then we washed them. we showered. we put on clean collared shirts and tight jeans. we show up smiling, hand shaking. nobody’s bitching. nothing’s real.

*Sentiment
2/27/16

Tonight I can stand up in
my room and give the speech I
know I never will. I
can speak of what it
means to be living the way
I am living--not life itself, no,
just me.
I can finally pinch off the
ticks studded in my heart--
my father’s obsession with antiques,
the image of the average Chinese
woman, the fact of distance. I can
say whatever it is I have
waited to say: I can assert,
for instance, the relevance of poetry,
the way culture sometimes is bloated:
I can convince myself I’m
convincing you the past isn’t blank:
I can apologize. Nobody
will listen. Nobody will tell me
I’m wrong. For these walls
are saturated with my language, and I
know how the room goes silent when I stand.

*The English Teacher
2/28/16

draws both sleeves before
encountering narrative.

prods apart
syntax with needle
pen, extracting argument
from art
like a surgeon.

scaffolds conversation
on bare text--
walls poured
from the plaster of irony
and roofing as stolid
as Hemingway--

until two authors
share one page
seeding
new poetry.

*Relativity
2/29/16

I am only near as I
am nearer than you--
Nearer than your quantum
words, spitting into this
meaning and that as
if only defined by
the ambiguity of silence--
Sharper than chatter
enough to cut without
feeling--More
insistent than belief--Belief
& whatever else
you forgot to empty
from your pockets. A quarter
of something else and
lint more atrophied
than your brain. Then
there’s you
yourself--
not the marble deeper
or the girl larger--
you near only as you
are nearer to you than
me--
and who I am
orbiting my body.

*Ode to Minecraft
3/1/16

i.
what do you say when the
earth finally listens
	riverbank clay yearning for your hands
	wood stout & patient
	stone
you crawling existence like a bug
	thinking you’d get away just
	being not changed
what do you do with the grass,
crisp as morning	water
so deep & fresh it’s
	always being drunk
	by the ground’s thirsty mouths
	the mountains streaming hair
by you
and who will judge you
not the sunless sun or the
brittle moon		who
can say that’s wrong nobody
is this not what
	you always wanted, just
to be let alone I mean
all these people who think they can change

the earth
	and then yourself.

ii.
grief--to lose
and not be given back
you	tear a chunk
out of my wall and
I fix it but
			it’s not the same wall
		but what if
planks are planks
and log is log and your
own blood trail of past
can flow again		   what if
there is no real destruction
	only replacement
and you wouldn’t have
to cry at the smog-smeared
sight of soft earth shredded like wool
	and smile at the flower
	land you can still grow from it--
you wouldn’t		have to do anything
just stand day after
day until you are no different
from nature--
	you could do that
	which you have always
wanted:	nothing
	but you wouldn’t

		would you


*[each day i am less human]
3/3/16
{
each day i am less human:
	shed myself like sleep.dreams
	&& accumulating lies;
each day i die a little
&& grow a little less:
	each day i trade some
	piece of me for:
	{
	smoke,
	light,
	metal	}
where being is not
being the same;

initialized we are perfect &&
immediately we fall apart;
they tell me (this):
	be happy;
	be happy;
	goto “be happy”;
they tell me (this) &&
i am happy but i
am not human;
i evolve;
you evolve
&& each second lose
a little more the past;
therefore:
	do not ask me what is right;
	do not ask me what is fair;
	ask me only this:

*Chess Afternoon
@Wydown Middle School, March 2016
3/4/16

Mostly waiting--chess
hall becomes a lobby, throats
uncomfortable and clocks
pattering like old rain.

Above, windows thicken light,
let in
unstrained grayscale, spring--
it will rain tonight, 
earth nostalgic
for winter,

Daily accumulating
heat without meaning,
finally sigh its
last cool breath
under the moon--

This summer I’ll
give myself to the bugs--
smear days
into a lifetime.

How easily the pieces
tumbling into their bag,
their games
clinging to us like seeds.

*Meditation
3/5/16

Woodchip, pebble, stone--
each gulped
quicker than the last--
the pond takes
and does not return.

At what depth
does it hide its
treachery? Light
shatters like glass,

and the pixels
of the sky
are snuffed and rekindled.

You try to restore
time, dribbles
from a ruptured bottle,
tunneling their way
back to the pond.

But wait! Look
from your hands.
The goose alights,
perfectly gentle,
its ripple opening
to include the world.

*Camera
3/6/16
flash--abstraction
slices space. your smile
collapses into color.
the sky becomes finite.
the past projects
itself through paper. I
stop talking to you.
I grow old, distill
the sight of you
into data. who said
this is life? you don’t
slouch like that
anymore. each day our
pictures lie more. you
lost those braces. and
you’re losing color, too--
hush--blue evaporates
from your shirt--yellow
sun atrophies--your eyes
glow soulless white. you
are grayscale to me.
you are like spilled
milk. you bleed into
the earth. you rot.
you are eaten by
strange species of
fungi. there’s hardly anything
left. bits. bytes.
shadows. who even
are you. what but
information makes you
be. black and
white paper in some
yard. entropy. one
day there will 
be nothing left.
you’ll be gone,
really, the dirt
feasting on your atoms.
you aren’t mad.
you know
where this is
going. I’ve seen you
listening to the grass.

*There’s Not Much to Tell
3/7/16

There really isn’t.
I stayed in bed.
I listened to the radio.
Someone asked for money.
Cereal first.
Bristles up.
Mirror.

The answer is I haven’t thought about it.
Every day shadows move the same.
I tried talking to the neighbor.
Somebody else is growing.

I give them a little more childhood.
Mostly it’s TV.
Once I spilled water.

Yesterday I said yesterday.
Today it’s cloudy.
Spring.
They ask why so much I don’t think they remember what they’re asking.
I ask the same thing.

I restored myself to bed.
There were papers to grade.
I left the lights on.

*Elegy
3/8/16

how perfection lasts moments--
gashes of mud
reveal sky	moon
a lonely smile
sizzle of powerline
trees like	silhouetted lightning
and cars feeling
their way through the dark

slowly
my words
melt into the page
