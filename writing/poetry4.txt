Ode to a Thing in Three Parts

i.
what name will absolve u?
from wood & steel u
came & to wood &
steel u don’t want to go back.
thing, u cling to existence like
most things do, like food that
hates to stay eaten. ur
insecure wires think they
still fit your grooves. ur twin
clamps clack like unrenewed friends.

ii.
thing what is it u
want me to do? will my
fingers redefine u? will u
ingratiate yourself into the
being of another? is it really
becoming if it’s less?

iii.
& u r really abstraction
thing
when i tried giving u a chance
u could have made urself couldnt u
u could have fixed urself
what is death but ambiguity
thing u could have
& is nothing forever &
how long is that
