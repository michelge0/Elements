Snow
It’s snowing and the air
is made of paper. I’m
breathing it, tearing it. And you’re
not here right now and
between us only wind folding.
Did you ever think about that?
The small creases that we leave—
gently refilling, so careful
you could glance away for just a second
and look back to find only white.
