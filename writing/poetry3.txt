Yellow Light

I tell you I’m a terrible
driver and you’re like what’s
that supposed to mean. I’m
like I almost crashed into the
mailman and you don’t
want to see me park. I can’t
tell how much less
interested you are so I start
talking about the yellow
light I almost didn’t run.

So I tried to slow and
ended up inertial in the middle
of the intersection and my
dad’s like kid either you
stop all the way or
step on it straight through.
You are mostly not laughing.
Oh shit. What
are you thinking? I ask.

You’re like I’m not thinking
about much. You start
to look away.
The light changes.
