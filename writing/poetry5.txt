To Walden

I ask for meaning &
you give me the
goose.

seedy hicks like
swans fallen in with
the wrong crowd & four
years into a drug
problem that’s not going anywhere.

I don’t think I’ll
ever tire of watching those
rubber necks jack-
hammering their own feathers but
that’s another story.

almost too perfect how
they glide like
origami as if
shitting’s not enough.

those beaks snatching water
and then necks.

wings buffing and snorting
as the crowd gathers.

so it begins:
another spring, another
garbage pond and two
feathered chests bumping in
what I can never tell is
sex or war.
