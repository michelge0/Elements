poem for people who don’t want to go back to high school

don’t you wish life was
algebra--you know, the tangled
script falling asleep on its own
fractions that you still can’t
remember how to solve--I
know what you are thinking, why
would I ever want to give
breath to such a nightmare but
believe me it wouldn’t be
so bad, everything would be right
there, all the answers, and all
you’d need to find them is the
stuff you’ve yet to remember--
complete the square, rationalize
the denominator and even if you
are reading this thinking who
does this guy think he is and
what the hell is he saying don’t
you realize how much freer you
could be with all the messes
you’ll ever snag against up there
for the solving, everything you
will ever be depressed by waiting
for you to unravel the truth,
and all you have to do is this:
let zero cancel zero:
revert problem into solution,
knot into string, follow
smoke home to fire.
