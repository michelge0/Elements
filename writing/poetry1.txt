Ode to Chinatown

I hit you like a speed bump.
You and your red lamps
fat on light, family-safe alleys
where all men look like Grandpa--
you’re the awkward one here.
Shuffling your feet halfway
between San Francisco and the sea,
you chose not
to realize you don’t belong,
to wait in my way
not even smiling with your
sizzling, smoky, sour teeth,
just breathing. To whom
do you call? Aren’t you tired
of lies? But even this
you don’t notice. You go on mumbling.
Your face is sheer as snow.
I drive past, tongue cold
from the bitter scald of tea.
